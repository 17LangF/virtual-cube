<HELP>
HELP function
(Default function='GENERAL').

Returns help page for a specific function.
</HELP>

<INPUT>
INPUT state

Input the state of your cube.

Enter the colours of your cube starting from the U face, followed by the L, F,
R, B, and D faces, from top to bottom, left to right.

If the cube state is not solvable, then the program will give a reason why.

This may cause problems with some other functions depending on the state.
</INPUT>

<INVERT>
INVERT

Goes to the inverse scramble and reverses moves.

Scramble moves become the inverse of the current moves.
Current moves become the inverse of the scramble moves.
</INVERT>

<LOAD>
LOAD filename
(Default filename='Cube').

Loads a cube from a previously saved file.

The file should be a txt file located in the 'saves' folder created by the
SAVE function.
</LOAD>

<LINK>
LINK

Returns an alg.cubing.net link for the cube.

Size must be from 1x1 to 17x17 to be supported by alg.cubing.net.
</LINK>

<MIRROR>
MIRROR slice
(Default slice='M').

Mirrors all previous moves and scramble moves across a slice (M, E, or S).
</MIRROR>

<MOVECOUNT>
MOVECOUNT metric
(Default metric='OVERVIEW').

MOVECOUNT OVERVIEW - Returns movecount in HTM, QTM, STM, and ETM.
</MOVECOUNT>

<PLAY>
PLAY moves

PLays through moves one at a time.

Enter key - step through the moves one at a time.
EXIT - skips to the end of the solve (Ctrl+C also does the same).
PLAY tps - animates the moves (this should only be used in 3D SHOW mode).
    (Default is tps=size ^ 2 / 2 + 1).
    If tps is 0, then the moves are played at maximum speed.
    If tps is xN, then the moves are played N times the default speed.
    Ctrl+C to the stop the animation.

Moves may play slower than the given tps for large cube sizes as it takes more
time to show the cube.
</PLAY>

<REPEAT>
REPEAT moves limit
(Default limit=1260).

Repeats moves until solved or when the limit is reached.
</REPEAT>

<RESET>
RESET size
(Default size='ALL').

Resets cube and sets cube size.

The cube state, moves, and scramble moves are reset.

2x2 - 15
3x3 - 25
4x4 - 40
5x5 - 60
6x6 - 80
7x7 - 100

In general, an nxn cube larger than a 3x3 has scramble length 20*(n-2).

The scramble is played using the PLAY function. Use HELP PLAY for more
information.
</SCRAMBLE>

<SHOW>
SHOW showstyle
(Default showstyle is the last showstyle used).

Shows cube.

SHOW OFF - turns off show function.
SHOW ON - turns on show function.

SHOW 3D - uses Python Turtle to display a 3D drawing of the cube.
SHOW 2D - prints cube in the terminal as a 2D net.

In 3D mode:
SHOW xr yr zc zoom
(Default xr=38, yr=28, zc=0.1, zoom=180, pensize=9).

xr - the angle of rotation about the x axis in degrees. -38 <= xr <= 38.
yr - the angle of rotation about the y axis in degrees. -45 <= yr <= 45.
zc - the size difference between close and far points.
zoom - how much larger the picture is drawn. Negative inverts drawing.
pensize - thickness of the blacklines. Default is abs(zoom) / (5 * size + 5).

Clicking on the drawing moves the drawing around so that the F face moves
towards the mouse.

In 2D mode:
SHOW sticker colour_code spaces
(Default sticker='██', colour_code='fg,colour', spaces=True).

If sticker is 'letters', then the stickers will be shown with letters.
Use 'block' for two block characters ██.

If spaces is True, then the face will be separated.

If arguments are not given then the last used arguments will be used.

Colour codes:
colour - Colour of sticker in R,G,B
fg - Foreground colour (38, 2) followed by colour in R,G,B.
bg - Background colour (48, 2) followed by colour in R,G,B.
0 - No colour
4 - Underline

Colour codes are separated with commas.
</SHOW>

<SIMPLIFY>
SIMPLIFY move_types
(Default move_types='ALL').

Simplifies moves by cancelling moves where possible and more if desired.

Move types:
CANCEL - cancels adjacent moves where possible.
    e.g. U U becomes U2, Uw Uw2 becomes Uw'.
PARALLEL - cancels moves which are parallel.
    e.g. L R L becomes L2 R, L Lw L becomes L2 Lw.
WIDE - removes wide moves and reduce the depth of turns where possible.
    e.g. on 3x3, Rw becomes L x. On 5x5, 3Rw becomes Lw x.
SLICE - removes slice moves.
    e.g. on 3x3, M becomes L' Lw. On 5x5, 2-3Rw becomes R' 3Rw.
ROTATION - moves all rotations to the end and simplifies them.
    e.g. x U becomes F x, x2 y2 becomes z2.
ALL - combines all of the above.

Move types can be combined, so to remove wide and slice moves enter:
SIMPLIFY WIDE SLICE
</SIMPLIFY>

<SOLVE>
SOLVE method cubes
(Default method is the first method below for the current cube size, cubes=1).

Computer tries to solve cube with a particular method.

Statistics include:
MOVECOUNT (in HTM, QTM, STM, and ETM).
TIME - Time the computer took to find a solution to the nearest microsecond.

The movecount in ETM for each substep in the method.
For Old Pochmann, the piece swaps are described using Speffz letter scheme.

When solving multiple cubes, the cube is repeatedly scrambled and solved.
The average (mean), best, and worst statistics and the total time to scramble
and solve is shown.

Methods for different cube sizes:
0x0 - None

1x1 - None

2x2 - OPTIMAL
    Solves cube in the fewest moves (HTM). Solutions are 3-gen, so only use U,
    F, and R moves. Note: the first solve will be significantly slower than
    average for the program to read the file.

2x2 - OP or OLD POCHMANN
    Solves cube using setup moves and swaps. Corners are solved using the
    Y-permutation with buffer at A.

3x3 - CFOP or FRIDRICH
    Solves cube using the CFOP method.

3x3 - BEGINNERS
    Solves cube using the beginners method shown in my YouTube tutorial at
    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK2USJVFiYlPh9ZGiMBE3Qd4fzomnM0Qw.

3x3 - OP or OLD POCHMANN
    Solves cube using setup moves and swaps. Edges are solved using the
    T-permutation with buffer at B. Parity is solved using the Ra-permutation.
    Corners are solved using the Y-permutation with buffer at A.

3x3 Substeps:
    CROSS
    FIRST LAYER
    F2L
    OLL
    CORNERS
    EDGES

4x4+ - CAGE
    Solves cube by solving edges first, using commutators to solve centres,
    and then solving the cube as a 3x3 using CFOP.

4x4+ Substeps:
    EDGES
    CENTRES
    REDUCTION

The solve is excecuted using the PLAY function. Use HELP PLAY for more
information.
</SOLVE>

<SPEEDSOLVE>
SPEEDSOLVE

Solve the cube as fast as you can and gives statistics on solve.

The cube is scrambled in the default method, and will start timing once the
first turn is made, or once 15 seconds (inspection) is reached.

Enter moves to solve the cube. Other functions include:

EXIT - Ends solve.
TIME - Returns current solving time.

Solve times are shown in the format days:minutes:hours:seconds.milliseconds.
Leading 0s are removed.

Statistics include:
TIME
MOVECOUNT (in HTM, QTM, STM, and ETM).
TPS - Turns per second, calculated using ETM.
START TIME - Time the cube is first seen.
END TIME - Time solve is ended.
</SPEEDSOLVE>

<UNDO>
UNDO number
(Default number=1).

Reverses last move or last number of moves.
If number is 'ALL' then all moves are reversed.
</UNDO>

<NOTATION>
NOTATION

Possible moves

Face turns
U - Up
L - Left
F - Front
R - Right
B - Back
D - Down

Add a number to say how many times to turn that layer clockwise, e.g. U2.
Add a prime symbol to make the layer turn anticlockwise, e.g. U'.

Wide moves
Add the letter 'w' to a face turn to turn 2 layers at once, e.g. Uw.
Alternatively, using a lowercase letter also turns 2 layers at once, e.g. u.

Add a number in front of the face turn to specify the number of layers to
turn, e.g. 3Uw or 3u.

Wide block moves
Specify the start and end move depth separated by a hyphen in front of the
wide face turn. e.g. 2-3Uw or 2-3u.

Slice moves
M - Middle (follows L)
E - Equator (follows D)
S - Slice (follows F)

A capital slice move turns only the central layer.
A lowercase slice move turns everything but the two outer layers.

To turn a specific layer, add a number in front of a face turn, e.g. 2U.

Rotations
x (follows R)
y (follows U)
z (follows F)

These turn the whole cube.

The program also allows:
    Grouping - using round brackets, e.g. (R U R' U')
    Repetition - using a number after a bracket, e.g. (R U R' U')3
    Inverting - using an apostrophe after a bracket, e.g. (R U R' U')'
    Commutators - using square brackets with a comma, e.g. [R, U]
    Conjugates - using square brackets with a colon, e.g. [R: U]

So U is 1HTM, U2 is 1HTM, M is 2HTM, M2 is 2HTM, and x is 0HTM.

QTM - Quarter Turn Metric
In QTM, a move must be an outer quarter turn.
So U is 1QTM, U2 is 2QTM, M is 2QTM, M2 is 4QTM, and x is 0QTM.

STM - Slice Turn Metric or Block Turn Metric
In STM, a move can be any outer turn, or a slice move.
So U is 1STM, U2 is 1STM, M is 1STM, M2 is 1STM, and x is 0STM.

ETM - Execution Turn Metric
In ETM, a move can be any outer turn, slice move, and rotations count are

So U is 1ETM, U2 is 1ETM, M is 1ETM, M2 is 1ETM, and x is 1ETM.

QSTM - Qurater Slice Turn Metric
In QTSM, a move can be an outer quater turn, or quarter slice move.
So U is 1QSTM, U2 is 2QTSM, M is 1QTSM, M2 is 2QTSM, and x is 0QTSM.

ATM - Axis Turn Metric
In ATM, a move can be any turn within the same axis.
